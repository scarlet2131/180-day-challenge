1.From goldman sachs set geeksforgeeks - solved 
    a.) find the first non repeating character(2 methods)
        i.) One storing count and teversing twice in the length of string.
        ii.) Travered once in the string and stored the first occcurence of each char 

            #though above two approaches takes the same time complexity bt if the input string would be very long then time taken wll be more.

2. Longest Decreasing subsequence 
    a.) Recursion approach (time complexity - 2^n)
    b.) DP (time complexity - n^2)

    Pending - nlogn approach, iterative 2^n;

3. Intermediate hackerrank certification.
    a.) string based question
    b.) largest rectangle formed by making partitions vertical and horizonntal(Advanced binary search)---
        Alternate question Link - On spoj(Ada and field).
